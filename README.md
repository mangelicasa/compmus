## corpus
For my corpus I am prospecting into teenage years. For this, I will be analyzing my Spotify Wrapped playlists from the years 2016 to 2023. As I approach my 20th birthday, this analysis serves as a reflective exploration of the music, emotions, and memories that defined my adolescence.

By examining the music I listen to, I aim to explore the evolution of my musical tastes, emotional landscapes, and life experiences throughout my teenage years. Some questions I could answer are: did the pandemic change my music taste? How does falling in love change my music listening?

Some limitations of this study are that especially in the first years Spotify Wrapped may not be completely representative as I would use other platforms to listen to music.

Regarding genre, I think there will be a common factor in all the playlists: Pop music. This might be especially prevalent in 2016 as I was not actively trying to discover other genres. A special case is 2017. I remember I started to like Lofi a lot but after a while, I stopped listening to it so it might be reflected in energy or danceability measures.
